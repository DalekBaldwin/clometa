CLOMeta
=======

An OMeta implementation in Common Lisp. Non-fully-featured interpreter based on [Vlad Kozin's implementation in Racket](https://github.com/vkz/ometa-racket) and bootstrapped from [optima](https://github.com/m2ym/optima). Compiler bootstrapped from interpreter, with some inspiration from optima's implementation. Deliberate deviations from official OMeta semantics.

This is very much in the feel-out-the-proper-shape-of-the-code-as-I-write-it phase, so pardon the mess.
